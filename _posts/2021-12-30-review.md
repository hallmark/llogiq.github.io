title: Rust 2021 â€“ Looking Back and Forth
---

2021 was a great year for Rust. The language got more
[powerful](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44580#issuecomment-991782799). The standard
library gained a good number of new functions and a lot of improvements on the existing ones. The
error messages were tweaked and tweaked again. The compiler got
[faster](https://nnethercote.github.io/2021/11/12/the-rust-compiler-has-gotten-faster-again.html)
still, despite
[at last enabling noalias information by default](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88325).

Also [incremental compilation the default](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/07/29/Rust-1.54.0.html)
again after being backed out due to soundness problems. We got a 
[new experimental gcc-based backend](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#internal-changes),
and another gcc-based implementation (both are work in progress for now). Clippy gained a number of
lints and lost a lot of false positives in turn. Rust is 
[getting into the Linux kernel](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-linux-kernel.html),
which also brings some improvements to both language and libraries to facilitate this feat.

The community also grew. [Crates.io](https://crates.io) is now at more than 70000 crates in stock, 
and more than 11 billion downloads! The [rust subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/rust) grew from about 
122k to more than 162k users, narrowly trailing [r/golang](https://reddit.com/r/golang). Rust 
[entered the top 20 of the Redmonk index](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2021/08/05/language-rankings-6-21/)
for the first time, and won the 
[Stack Overflow survey's](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)
"Most loved programming language" crown for the sixth year in a row. I've had more people ask me 
for mentoring than ever before.

We have a [foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/) which is gaining members. The foundation has actually started to do useful
stuff, like 
[professionally organizing the operations](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-10-18-crates-io-oncall-ferrous-systems/)
of crates.io which has so far been done by volunteers. Recently, the
[DevX initiative](https://medium.com/concordium/the-devx-initiative-sponsorship-program-goals-and-principles-e640063eeaa7)
has started sponsoring work on Rust. This is great news for Rust and Open Source alike!

That's not to say all has been roses. The 
[mod team quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qzme1z/moderation_team_resignation/)
due to a problem with the rules not allowing us to enforce the CoC. Fortunately, there is
[active work underway](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2021/12/17/follow-up-on-the-moderation-issue.html)
to fix this problem, and the new mod team also seems to be doing a good job as far as I can tell.

We still have a
[security flaw](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qqu1bw/what_should_we_do_about_cve202026235_localtime_r/)
in one of the most popular time/date libraries, which most seem to simply have forgotten about. Ok, 
it's fixed in time 0.3, but not in chrono so far. At least we have a 
[CVE](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0159.html) to remind us of that.

Looking forward, we're going to see more of the same. The compiler will be getting more powerful
while speeding up even more. Features that people have been missing are in the process of being
implemented and will arrive in the new year. The error message code will at one point become
sentient and decide to send a robot back in time to save mankind from skynet or something. The
community will continue to grow, and more Rust jobs will be available, ready to be taken by more
Rust programmers.

My guess is that we will see more active involvement from the foundation in the new year, which is
great news to the community. The work started after the mod team change will likely conclude within
the second quarter of 2022, improving the governance structure and paving the way for even more
success in the future.

With a bit of luck we will find a way to harden our systems against supply-chain attacks before
they become a real problem. We likely need more integration, documentation and raising awareness.

I still see some risk that there might be a tipping point where the backlash against the out of
control grift around blockchains will also harm Rust by association, because many projects in that
space use the language because of performance, safety and productivity. Knocking on wood here.

Around us, the pandemic is still raging. Meetup activity has gone online or is reduced. More people
work remotely than ever before. My hope and wish is for all of you to stay safe & healthy.
